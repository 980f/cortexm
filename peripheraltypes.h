/**
 *  types used for declaration of peripherals.
 *
 *  The SFR* template classes have a peculiar usage pattern, caused by trying to make all related code be generated inline.
 *  At hardware module definition time one creates a typedef for each field rather than an instance.
 *  At each place of use one creates an instance and then assigns to that instance to write a value or simply reference that instance for a read.
 *  This precludes extern'ing global instances which then must take up real data space (const so not a big cost) and then be accessed via an extra level of indirection compared to what the 'create local instance' can result in.
 *  If we could create a global instance in a header file but get just one actual object created we would do that.
 * Volatile is used to keep the compiler from optimizing away accesses that have physical side effects.
I am working on replacing *'s with &'s, its a statistical thing herein as to which is better.

 #pragma ide diagnostic ignored "google-explicit-constructor"
 #pragma ide diagnostic ignored "misc-unconventional-assign-operator"

 we want these classes to appear to be normal program variables, so that we can replace instances of them with normal program variables to disable them with only changing the declaration.
