/** Instead of having a long list of particularly spelled interrupt handler names and also a list of interrupt number names we can get by with just
 * the number names and generate handler names from them.
 *
 * The IrqName and HandleInterrupt macros below are used in application code, and you can make macros like UartIrq(uartNumber) and use those
 * both in the interrupt controls defined here (class Irq) and to mark the handler.
 *
 * Most interrupt handlers are oneliners that call a shared function with an arugment for the instance of the peripheral.
 *
 * #define myIrqNum 29
 * const Irq myIrq(myIrqNum);
 * ...
 * myIrq.setPriority(...);
 * ...
 * HandleInterrupt(myIrqNum){
 *   myObject.handle();
 * }
 *
 * ******************************
 *
 * The following do the same for faults:
 * FaultName(faultIndex) MACRO_cat(FAULT , faultIndex)
 * FaultHandler(name, faultIndex)
 * HandleFault(faultIndex)
 *
 * ******************************
 *
 * This allows us to build the vector table with names that are independent of the peripherals, which means that they are also
 * independent of the vendor other than for the highest valued interrupt that can occur.
 * I weak define all of them to a common "unhandled interrupt handler".
 * My version of that handler disables the interrupt, using the NVIC registers to figure that out.
 * You may wish to put a halt there instead of a simple disable and return.
 *
 * That takes up less bytes of rom than the usual copy of "branch here" for each handler.
