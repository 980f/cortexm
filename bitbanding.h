 * bitbanding is not available in all cortex devices. M0's rarely if ever have it, neither do the superscalars as those also have caches which can't stay coherent as the bitband action would have to be implemented in them as well as in the memory bus controller.
 *
 * while initially this could be a namespace it is intended in the future to be a base class for a peripheral that has interesting bits.
